Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy film directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a
 reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress
  for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won.

It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a
credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in
2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored. Blacklisted director Bernard Vorhaus worked on the
film as an assistant director under a pseudonym.

It was shot at the Cinecittà studios and on location around Rome during the "Hollywood on the Tiber" era. The film was
screened in the 14th Venice film festival within the official program.

In 1999, Roman Holiday was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of
Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

POST

Ann (Audrey Hepburn), a crown princess on a state visit to Rome, becomes frustrated with her tightly scheduled life and
secretly leaves her country's embassy. The delayed effect of a sedative eventually makes her fall asleep on a bench,
where Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), an expatriate reporter for the "American News Service", finds her without recognizing
who she is. He offers her money so she can take a taxi home, but she is too woozy. Thinking she is intoxicated, Joe finally
lets her spend the night in his apartment.

The next morning, Joe hurries off late to work and gives his editor, Mr. Hennessy (Hartley Power), false details of his
press conference with the princess. It is only when Hennessy informs him that the event had been cancelled and shows him
a news item about her “sudden illness” that he realizes who it actually is in his apartment. Seeing an opportunity, Joe
proposes getting an exclusive interview with the princess and Hennessy agrees, offering $5,000 if the interview is all
Joe claims it will be, but betting Joe $500 that he will not succeed.

Joe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show his guest "Anya" around Rome. He also
surreptitiously calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), to tag along and secretly take pictures.
However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves. Enjoying her freedom, she explores an outdoor market and, on impulse, gets
her long hair cut short. Joe follows and ‘accidentally’ meets her on the Spanish Steps. This time he convinces her to
spend the day with him and takes her to a street café, where he meets up with Irving. Later, when she tries to drive
the Vespa on which he has taken her for a ride, they are arrested and only get away with it when he and Irving show
their press passes
That night, at a dance on a boat, government agents called in by the embassy finally track Ann down and try to force her
away. Ann takes part in the fight that breaks out, during which Joe is ambushed and falls into the river and Ann jumps
in to save him. After they swim away and police arrest the agents, they share a kiss as they sit shivering on the
riverbank. Later, knowing her royal responsibilities must resume, Ann bids a tearful farewell to Joe and returns to
the embassy. Her minders there try to lecture her upon the sense of duty a princess must display, but she retorts
that without such a sense she would never have returned.

Meanwhile, Hennessy has come to suspect that the princess was not ill as claimed and tries to get Joe to admit what he
knows about it. Joe, however, has decided not to write the story, although he later tells Irving that he is free to sell
his photographs if he wishes. They then leave for the postponed press conference at the embassy, surprising Princess Ann.
When asked by a reporter which city on her European tour was her favorite, Ann first starts with a diplomatic "all were
equally good" answer, but then impulsively replies, "Rome! By all means Rome."

At the end of the interview, the princess unexpectedly asks to meet the journalists, shaking hands and speaking briefly
with each. As she reaches Joe and Irving, the latter presents her with an envelope containing the photographs he had taken.
The two men make it clear to her (but no one else) that they will keep silent about her adventure. After the interview
comes to an end and the crowd of newspapermen disperses, Joe walks away alone.

CAST

Wyler first offered the role to Hollywood favorite Cary Grant. Grant declined,[4] believing he was too old to play Hepburn's
love interest (though he played opposite her ten years later in Charade.) Other sources say Grant declined because he knew
all of the attention would be centered around the princess.[5] Peck's contract gave him solo star billing, with newcomer
Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Halfway through the filming, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate
her to equal billing—an almost unheard-of gesture in Hollywood.

Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann (Anya "Smitty" Smith)

Wyler had initially considered Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons for this role, but both were unavailable.[6] Wyler was
very excited to find Hepburn, but he did not choose her until after a screen test. Wyler was not able to stay and film
this himself, but told the assistant director to ask the cameraman and the sound man to continue recording after the assistant
director said "cut" so that she would be seen in a relaxed state after having performed a dignified, subdued scene from
the film.[7] The candid footage won her the role; some of it was later included in the original theatrical trailer for
the film, along with additional screen test footage showing Hepburn trying on some of Ann's costumes and even cutting
her own hair (referring to a scene in the film). Roman Holiday was not Hepburn's first acting appearance (she had appeared
in Dutch and British films from 1948; and on stage, including the title role in a Broadway adaptation of Gigi) but it was
her first major film role and first appearance in an American film. Wyler wanted an "anti-Italian" actress who was different
from the curvy Italian maggiorate like Gina Lollobrigida, and said that "She was perfect .... his new star had no arse,
no tits, no tight-fitting clothes, no high heels. In short a Martian. She will be a sensation".[8]

Accolades

In 1999, Roman Holiday was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress
 as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

American Film Institute included the film as #4 in its AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions, and as #4 in the romantic comedy

Adaptations

The film was remade for television in 1987 with Tom Conti and Catherine Oxenberg, who is herself a member of a European
royal family. An unofficial Tamil-language adaptation, titled May Madham, was released in 1994.[13]

The Richard Curtis film Notting Hill has been likened to "a 90's London-set version of Roman Holiday".[14] There are a
number of allusions to it in the film, in which the princess character is replaced with "Hollywood royalty" and the commoner
 is a British bookshop owner.[15]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paramount Pictures has since licensed three adaptations of Roman Holiday into musicals:

    In 2012, a musical stage version, following the plot while using the songs of Cole Porter, was presented in Minneapolis.
    The book adaptation was done by Paul Blake (Beautiful: The Carole King Story).[16] It was scheduled for a run in San
    Francisco in summer 2017 before going on to Broadway.[17][18]

    Another version was staged in 2004 in Rome under the title Vacanze Romane using the Cole Porter score, supplemented
    with music by Italian film composer Armando Trovajoli. This production is performed annually at the Teatro Sistina in
    Rome and on tour in Italy and Spain.[19]

    A version entirely in Japanese with a completely different score was produced in 1998 by Toho [Japanese Theatre Company]
